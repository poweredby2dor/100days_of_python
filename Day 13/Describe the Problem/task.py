# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# The for loop is iterating through the defined range from 1 to (20 minus 1)

# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# When the value of i is 20.

# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# Range function works by starting at a given value and ending before the next given value.
